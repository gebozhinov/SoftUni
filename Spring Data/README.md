In the course we will look at the details of working with a modern ORM technology: 
Hibernate, which is practically a standard for ORM in Java applications. 
Hibernate allows mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) 
through appropriate "database first" and "code first" and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and performing CRUD operations from Java. 
Spring Data on your side on top of even more of a standard API and provides citizens with both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process database data. 
In the course, we will demonstrate best practices for building a database layer of complex systems in Java applications 
through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and creating a service layer (Service Layer), 
as well as importing and exporting to different data formats (JSON, XML).
