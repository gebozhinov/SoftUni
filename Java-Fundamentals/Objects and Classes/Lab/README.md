# Lab: Objects and Classes
Problems for exercises and homework for the "Programming Fundamentals" course @ SoftUni.

# I.	Using the Built-in Java Classes

## 1.	Randomize Words
You are given a list of words in one line. Randomize their order and print each word on a separate line

### Examples
| Input | Output | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Welcome to SoftUni and have fun learning programming|learning<br>Welcome<br>SoftUni<br>and<br>fun<br>programming<br>have<br>to|The order of the words in the output will be different after each program execution.|

### Hints
*	Split the input string (by space) and create an array of words.
*	Create a random number generator - an object rnd of type Random.
*	In a for-loop exchange each number at positions 0, 1, â€¦, words.Length-1 by a number at a random. position. To generate a random number in range use rnd.nextInt(words.length).
*	Print each word in the array on a new line.

## 2.	Sum Big Numbers
You will receive two numbers (0 to 1050), print their sum.

### Hints
Use the class BigInteger

## 3.	Big Factorial
You will receive N - the number in the range [0 - 1000]. Calculate the Factorial of N and print the result.

# II.	Defining Simple Classes

## 4.	Songs
Define a class Song, which holds the following information about songs: Type List, Name, and Time.

On the first line, you will receive the number of songs - N. 

On the next N-lines you will be receiving data in the following format: "{typeList}_{name}_{time}".

On the last line, you will receive "Type List" / "all". Print only the names of the songs which are from that Type List / All songs.

## 5.	Students
Define a class Student, which holds the following information about students: first name, last name, age, and hometown. 

Read the list of students until you receive the "end" command. After that, you will receive a city name. Print only students which are from the given city, in the following format: "{firstName} {lastName} is {age} years old".

### Examples

## 6.	Students 2.0
Use the class from the previous problem. If you receive a student which already exists (first name and last name should be unique) overwrite the information.

### Examples
